## Overview
[Eclim](http://eclim.org) is an Eclipse plugin which exposes Eclipse
features through a server interface.  When this server is started, the
command line utility eclim can be used to issue requests to that
server.

Emacs-eclim uses the eclim server to integrate eclipse with
emacs. This project wants to bring some of the invaluable features
from eclipse to emacs.

It is also possible to start and stop the eclim daemon from emacs using the
`eclimd` package.

## Installation
1. [download and install](http://eclim.org/guides/install.html)
   eclim. Please note that emacs-eclim does *not* yet work with eclim
   1.7.3 or later. You need version 1.7.2.
1. download emacs-eclim
1. add the following code to your emacs startup script

        (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "/path/to/emacs-eclim/"))
        ;; only add the vendor path when you want to use the libraries provided with emacs-eclim
        (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/coding/git/emacs-eclim/vendor"))
        (require 'eclim)

        (setq eclim-auto-save t)
        (global-eclim-mode)
1. If you want to control eclimd from emacs, also add

        (require 'eclimd)

## Configuration

### Eclipse installation

Emacs-eclim tries its best to locate your Eclipse installation.  If
you have Eclipse installed in a non-standard location
(i.e. ~/opt/eclipse) you have to options:

* Either customize the `eclim-executable` variable to make it point to the `eclim` executable within the Eclipe directory if necessary
* Or, you can override the lookup by adding the following to your startup script.

        (custom-set-variables
         '(eclim-eclipse-dirs '("~/opt/eclipse")))

### Displaying compilation error messages in the echo area

When the cursor is positioned on an error marker in a code buffer,
emacs-eclim uses the local help feature in emacs to display the
corresponding error message in the echo area. You can either invoke
`(display-local-help)` manually or activate automatic display of local
help by adding the following to .emacs:

	(setq help-at-pt-display-when-idle t)
	(setq help-at-pt-timer-delay 0.1)
	(help-at-pt-set-timer)

### Configuring auto-complete-mode

If you wish to use [auto-complete-mode] with emacs-eclim, add the
following to your .emacs:

	;; regular auto-complete initialization
	(require 'auto-complete-config)
	(ac-config-default)

	;; add the emacs-eclim source
	(require 'ac-emacs-eclim-source)
	(add-hook 'eclim-mode-hook (lambda () (add-to-list 'ac-sources 'ac-source-emacs-eclim)))

### Configuring company-mode

Emacs-eclim can integrate with [company-mode] to provide pop-up
dialogs for auto-completion. To activate this, you need to add the
following to your .emacs:

	(require 'company)
	(require 'company-emacs-eclim)
	(company-emacs-eclim-setup)
	(global-company-mode t)

### Configuring eclimd module

When `emacs-eclim` is configured correctly, you don't need to modify the
configuration for the `eclimd` package. Still, there are some configurable
variables you can tweak:

1. `eclimd-executable`: This variable is used for locating the `eclimd`
   executable file. You can set it to `nil` ("Same directory as eclim-executable
   variable" choice in customization screen) to indicate that the executable is in
   the same directory as the `eclim` program. Alternatively, you can give it a
   string value ("Custom value" choice in customization screen) to specify the
   location of the executable.

1. `eclimd-default-workspace`: When `start-eclimd` is executed, it will ask for
   the workspace directory to use. The default value for this question is
   controlled by this variable.

1. `eclimd-wait-for-process`: Normally, when `start-eclimd` starts the eclimd
   process, it pauses emacs until `eclimd` is ready to accept commands. If you
   change the value of this variable to `nil`, `start-eclimd` will return as
   soon as `eclimd` is started. Eclimd startup takes several seconds, so if you
   change the default value of this variable, `emacs-eclim` commands will fail
   until `eclimd` is ready.

## Optional dependencies
* A recent version (0.6.0 or later) of [yasnippet]
* A recent version (tested with 0.5) of [company-mode]
* A recent version (tested with 1.4) version of [auto-complete-mode]
* ido-mode (part of emacs as of version 22)

## Usage
To get started just launch the eclim executable that the placed in
your Eclipse installation directory.

### Controlling eclimd

When you import the `eclimd` package, you will have access to two commands:
`start-eclimd`, and `stop-eclimd`.

`start-eclimd` will ask for a workspace directory, and it will attempt to start
`eclimd` program with the entered workspace directory. The configurable variable
`eclimd-default-workspace` controls the default value of this directory. After
`start-eclimd` runs the daemon, it will monitor its log output, and wait for the
message that indicates that it is ready to accept commands. This is done to
prevent failures with `emacs-eclim` commands while `eclimd` is starting up.
While `start-eclimd` is waiting for the daemon to be ready, emacs will not
accept any user input. To prevent this pause, you can modify the configurable
variable `eclimd-wait-for-process`.

Normally, simply killing the buffer `*eclimd*` will allow you to stop the eclimd
daemon. However, there is a command to perform a graceful shutdown:
`stop-eclimd`. You should use this command when you wish to stop the `eclimd`
program.
